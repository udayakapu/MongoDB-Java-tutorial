This is a simple tutorial using Java and MongoDB database.

This sample application includes the MongoDB driver from GitHub - https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/downloads

This application uses the sample zip code collection or database that's available for download using the following
url: http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json

Once you install MongoDB on your machine, import the zips.json file using the following command:

    mongoimport.exe --db ZipCodes --collection zips --file zips.json

Once the data is imported, using the command line mongo tools to validate the load of the data or run
the Java class that's included here.
